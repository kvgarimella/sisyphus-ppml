## Taylor Series Approximation of Activation Functions
This directory contains the code to build [Taylor Series Approximations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series#Definition) of commonly used activation functions. 

### Files:
1. `generate_taylor_approx_coeffs.py`: generates Taylor coefficients for any differentiable
2. `taylor_expansion_approx.py`: Implementation of SiLU and ReLU Taylor approximations
3. `test_taylor*.py`: Tests Taylor approximation of ReLU on a trained network
